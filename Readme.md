# RDS Monitoring Lambda

## AWS Config

### AWS Role Policy

Needs access to cloudwatch PutMetricData. Example policy:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudwatch:PutMetricData"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Lambda Config

- **Runtime**: Node v10.x

- **Handler**: `dist/index.handler`

## Run

Add all the RDS hosts to hosts array in config.js.

### Run in local

Uncomment `cloudWatch` entry in config.js and add aws access key and secret and set region accordingly.
Change password.
Call handler function in index.js

```sh
yarn
yarn build
yarn start
```

### Package for Lambda

```sh
yarn zip
```

Will output `function.zip` that can be uploaded.

## ENV VARS

Support is provided through [cfg](https://github.com/smartprix/cfg) module. It reads values from `config.js`, but they can be overwritten with another `config.js` in the `private` folder in the project root. Or through env vars in this format:

```sh
# Overwriting password (db.password):
CFG__DB__PASSWORD='password' yarn start
# Adding host to posiition 1 (hosts.1):
CFG__DB__HOSTS__1='new-host.region.rds.amazonaws.com'
```

It basically uses lodash.set internally. The path is generated by removing the `CFG__` prefix and replacing `__` with `.` and converting to camelCase (also through lodash).


## Metrics

Metrics are published in the `RDS` namespace with a `DBInstanceIdentifier` for the host.

### AutoIncrementCapacity

The maximum of the percentages of auto-increment number consumed.

### ChangeInDiskPerDay

The rate of change in disk usage by mysql per day.
